<h1>X.X Han</h1>

<h2>CJK Unified Ideographs</h2>

<p>The Unicode Standard contains a set of unified Han ideographic characters used in the written Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. The term <i>Han</i>, derived from the Chinese Han Dynasty, refers generally to Chinese traditional culture. The Han ideographic characters make up a coherent script, which was traditionally written vertically, with the vertical lines ordered from right to left. In modern usage, especially in technical works and in computer-rendered text, the Han script is written horizontally from left to right and is freely mixed with Latin or other scripts. When used in writing Japanese or Korean, the Han characters are interspersed with other scripts unique to those languages (Hiragana and Katakana for Japanese; Hangul syllables for Korean).</p>
