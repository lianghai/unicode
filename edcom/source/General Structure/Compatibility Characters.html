<h1 numbering>X.X Compatibility Characters</h1>

<p>Conceptually, compatibility characters are characters that would not have been encoded in the Unicode Standard except for compatibility and round-trip convertibility with other standards. Such standards include international, national, and vendor character encoding standards. For the most part, these are widely used standards that pre-dated Unicode, but because continued interoperability with new standards and data sources is one of the primary design goals of the Unicode Standard, additional compatibility characters are added as the situation warrants.</p>
